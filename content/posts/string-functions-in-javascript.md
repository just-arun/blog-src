Useful operations we can do on strings with built-in methods, such as finding the length of a text string, joining and splitting strings, substituting one character in a string for another, and more.

## Length
length is used to count the number of characters in string

```js
let str = "this is a string"
console.log(str.length)
// output
16
```
